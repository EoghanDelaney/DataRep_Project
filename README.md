## My Project
<p>My project consisted of creating a REST API with a web interface, consuming data from Twitters API and Google Maps API. The theme of the REST API was to highlight crime, geographically in Ireland.</p>

<p>A user can log a crime and select the location on a Google Map. Google Maps Api requires an authentication key which is included in the API script. All logged crimes are then displayed in the form of a table and on the maps.</p>

<p>As part of this project I used Twitter's API to get tweets relating to Crime in Ireland. Twitter uses four authentication keys to enable users to consume the API - consumer_key, consumer_secret, access_token, access_secret. This information was stored in a separate password file.</p>
